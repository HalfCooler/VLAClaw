"""Task-difficulty classification for telemetry and planning hints.

A larger model may classify the incoming task as easy, medium, or hard.  The
verdict no longer hands the whole run to the large model: the compact small
actor remains in control, while the large model is reserved for bounded
recovery/escalation calls.

* easy/medium/hard -> small GUI model + ``general_compact``

Repeat-plan escalation is unchanged: a confirmed repeated plan hands one
bounded step, plus the escalation hint, to the large model.
